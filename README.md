 	The game is currently being developed in **Unity** using **C#**.

	## Details
	The player will be able to travel through various lands Filled will friends and foes alike. 
 	NPCs can talked to for either lore expositions or to purchase useful items. Meanwhile enemies
  	will be roaming the overworld for the player to fight.

	Upon triggering a combat scenario with an enemy, the player will be presented with turn based
 	combat to which the player will command three party members to either fight or use an item.

	Furthermore the player will be able to acquire new party members to build the team that they 
 	want as they battle.
